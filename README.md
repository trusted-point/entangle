## Key Features
- Our bot serves as a vital tool for Entangle network participants, offering comprehensive insights into the network's dynamics, validators, governance proceedings, upcoming upgrades, emergency alerts, and key metrics.

- Alert Services: For validators and stakeholders, the bot provides subscription services for timely alerts. Users receive notifications about critical events such as block skipping, validator exclusion from an active set, commission adjustments, and more.

- Real-Time Block Streaming: The bot supports real-time streaming of newly produced blocks to a particular channel, enabling users to stay updated on network activities instantly.

- Validator Metrics: Users can easily find reliable validators to stake tokens through the bot's detailed metrics. These metrics include governance participation, total number of slashes, number of delegators, uptime, voting power, and more.

- Our bot can also perform an on-chain RPC and persistent peers scanning.
